Gesture UI Based Project
Working in a team of two to build a game controlled using a MYO armband. Using Unity and C# to create a 2D/3D game that allows you to traverse a spontaneously created environment and shoot obstacles and enemies with a variety of weapons.
High score being the objective.
Waves of enemies for levels.
