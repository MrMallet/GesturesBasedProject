# GesturesBasedProject
Gesture UI Based Project
Working in a team of two to build a game controlled using a MYO armband. Using Unity and C# to create a 2D game that allows you to traverse a spontaneously created environment and shoot obstacles and enemies with a variety of weapons.
High score being the objective.
Waves of enemies for levels.

Lecturer: Damien Costello

##By: James Moloney and Trevor Davies

##Purpose:
To demonstrate the use of gesture based UI using the Myo Armband and Unity 5.3.0

##Gestures:
During the creation of this project we found that using the fist pose for firing the weapons was best and the most natural posion.

##Conclusions & Recommendations:
The Myo ArmBand is a difficult Gesture based tool to use.
