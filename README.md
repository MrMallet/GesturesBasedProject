# GesturesBasedProject
Gesture UI Based Project
Working in a team of two to build a game controlled using a MYO armband. Using Unity and C# to create a 2D game that allows you to traverse a spontaneously created environment and shoot obstacles and enemies with a variety of weapons.
High score being the objective.
Waves of enemies for levels.

##Introduction:
As this project is about gesture based UI, we took a modified version of the Unity SpaceShooter tutorial and further modified it in order to demonstrate as many gestures as we could using the Myo ArmBand.

##Purpose:
The purpose of the applicatioon is to allow the user to controll a spaceship with the Myo Armband while dodging rocks,fight enemies and to demonstrate the use of gesture based UI using the Myo Armband and Unity 5.3.0. The user moves the ship left and right and fire weapons.


##Gestures:
During the creation of this project we found that using the fist pose for firing the weapons was best and the most natural posion.

Wave In pose used to cycle down through weapons list

Wave In pose used to cycle up through weapons list

Fist pose used to shoot continuosly

![Spread](https://github.com/TrevorDavies/GesturesBasedProject/blob/master/gitImages/Spread.png)
Spread pose used to recenter the ship in the middle of the scene.

##Hardware:
The only hardware used is the Myo Armband. We Generally found it to be difficult to use. Although when changing poses(gestures) within the game it seemed responsive, but we had a lot of problems when syncing the myo.

##Conclusions & Recommendations:
The Myo ArmBand is a difficult Gesture based tool to use.
