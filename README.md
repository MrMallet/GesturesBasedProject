# GesturesBasedProject
Gesture UI Based Project
Working in a team of two to build a game controlled using a MYO armband. Using Unity and C# to create a 2D game that allows you to traverse a spontaneously created environment and shoot obstacles and enemies with a variety of weapons.
High score being the objective.
Waves of enemies for levels.

Lecturer: Damien Costello

##By: James Moloney and Trevor Davies
##Introduction:
As this project is about gesture based UI, we took a modified version of the Unity SpaceShooter tutorial and further modified it in order to demonstrate as many gestures as we could using the Myo ArmBand.
Modifications:
##Purpose:
To demonstrate the use of gesture based UI using the Myo Armband and Unity 5.3.0

##Gestures:
During the creation of this project we found that using the fist pose for firing the weapons was best and the most natural posion.

Spread pose used to recenter the ship in the middle of the scene.

##Hardware:
Myo ArmBand.

##Conclusions & Recommendations:
The Myo ArmBand is a difficult Gesture based tool to use.
